# Chapter 9. Virtual Memory #

## 9.3 VM as a Tool for Cache ##

the set of virtual pages is partitioned into three disjoint subsets:
- Unallocated: Pages that have not yet been allocated (or created) by the VM system. do not have any data associated with them, and thus do not occupy any space on disk.
- Cached: Allocated pages that currently cached in physical memory.
- Uncached: Allocated pages that are not cached in physical memory.

### 9.3.2 Page Tables ###

if cached, VM system must have way to determine which physical page it is cached in.

if missed, select a victim page in physical memory, and copy the virtual page from disk to DRAM, replace the victim page.

- PTEs: _page table entries_
- VPs: _virtual pages_

The page faults:
1. selects VP 4 as the victim
2. replaces it with a copy of VP 3 from disk.

The kernel:
1. copies VP 3 from disk to PP 3 in memory
2. updates PTE 3,
3. VP 3 now cached in main memory
