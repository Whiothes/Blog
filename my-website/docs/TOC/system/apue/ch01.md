# Chapter 1. UNIX System Overview #

## 1.1 Introduction ##

operating system provide services for programs running.


## 1.2 UNIX Architecture ##

- kernel: control hardware resources of the computer and provides and environment under which program can run
- system calls: the interface to the kernel
- library routines: libraries of common functions are built on the top of the system call
- shell: special application tha provides an interface for running other applications

## 1.3 Logging in ##

### Login Name ###

`etc/passwd` stored user infomation

### Shells ###

## 1.4 Files and Descriptors ##

### File System ###

The UNIX file system is a hierarchical arrangement of directories and files.
    
### Filename ###

the names in a directory
    
### Pathname ###

a sequence of one or more filenames, separated by slashes and optionally startting with a slash.

### Working Directory ###

__Every process__ has a _working directory_, sometimes called the ___current__ working directory_.


### Home Directory ###

_login_ directory

## 1.5 Input and Output ##

### File Descriptors ###

small non-negative integers that the kernel uses to identify the files accessed by a process.

### Standard Input, Standard Output, and Standard Error ###

fd equal to 0, 1, 2

### Unbuffered I/O ###

Unbuffered I/O is provided by the functions `open`, `read`, `write`, `lseek`, and `close`.

### Standard I/O ###

provide a buffered interface to unbuffered I/O functions.

## 1.6 Program and Processes ##

### Program ###

A /program/ is an executable file residing on disk in a directory.

### Processes and Process ID ###

An executing instance of a program 

### Process Control ###

- Create: `fork`,
- Running: `exec`,
- Waiting: `waitpid`.

### Threads and Thread IDs ###

_All threads withina process share the same address space, file descriptors, stacks, and process-related attributes._

_Each thread executes on its own stack, although any thread can __access__ the stacks of other threads in the same process._

## 1.7 Error Handling ##

`<errno.h>`

supports _multithread_ access to errno by defining it as:
```c
extern int *__errno_location(void);
#define errno (*__errno_location())
```

### Error Recovery ###

- nonfatal: most nonfatal errors are temporary.
- fatal: no recovery action.

typical recovery action for a resource-related nonfatal error is to delay and retry later.

## 1.8 User Identification ##

### User ID ###

`passwd` file, a numeric value that identifies user to the system.

### Group ID ###

`passwd` file, a numeric value that identifies group to the system.

### Supplementary Group IDs ###

a user belongs to other groups

### 1.9 Signals ###

a technique used to notify other processes 

### 1.10 Time Values ###

1. Calendar time. counts the number of seconds since the Epoch: 1970-1-1 00:00:00
2. Process time. measures the central processor resources used by a process.

## 1.11 System calls and Library Functions ##

### ###


![Figure 1.11 Separation of malloc function and sbrk system call](img/01fig11.jpg)

_Figure 1.11 Separation of malloc function and sbrk system call_

system call in the kernel _allocate_ an additional chunk of space on behalf of the process.
the malloc library function _manages_ this space from user level.
