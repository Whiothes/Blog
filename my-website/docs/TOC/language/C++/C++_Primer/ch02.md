# Chapter 2. Variables and Basic Types

## 2.1. Primitive Built-in Types

### 2.1.1. Arithmetic Types

| Type         | Meaning           | Minimum Size            |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| bool         |                   | NA                      |
| char         |                   | 8 bits                  |
| **wchar_t**  | wide character    | 16 bits                 |
| **char16_t** | unicode character | 16 bits                 |
| **char32_t** | unicode character | 32 bits                 |
| short        |                   | 16 bits                 |
| int          |                   | 32 bits                 |
| long         |                   | 64 bits                 |
| long long    |                   | 64 bits                 |
| float        |                   | **6** sinificant bits   |
| double       |                   | **10** significant bits |
| long double  |                   | **10** significant bits |

### 2.1.3 Literals

```cpp
  L'a'   // wide character literal, type is wchar_t
  u8"hi!"  // utf-8 string literal (utf-8 encodes a Unicode character in 8bits)
  42ULL   // unsigned integer literal, type is unsigned long long
  1E-3F   // single-precision floating-point literal, float
  3.14159L // extended-precision floating-point literal, double
```

> _Best Practice_
>
> â€‹ use uppercase `L` when write `long` literal, `l` is easily mistaken for the digit `1`

## 2.3. Compound Types

### 2.3.1. References

A _reference_ defines an alternative name for an object.

```cpp
int ival = 1024;
int &refVal1 = ival;    // refVal refers to (is another name for) ival
int &refVal2;      // error: a reference must be initialized
```

> Note
>
> **A reference is not an object.** Instead, a reference is just **another name** for an **already existing** object.

### 2.3.2. Pointers

```cpp
int ival = 42;
int *p = &ival; // p holds the address of ival: p is a pointer to ival
```

#### Null Pointers

```cpp
int *p1 = nullptr; // equivalent to int *p1 = 0;
int *p2 = 0;       // directly initializes p2 from the literal constant 0
int *p3 = NULL;    // equivalent to int *p3 = 0;
```

`nullptr` is a literal that has a special type that can be converted to any other pointer type,.

> Advice: Initialize all Pointers
>
> Uninitialized pointers are a common source of run-time errors.

**The most important differences between _reference_ and _pointer_ is a reference is not an object. There is no way to make a defined reference refer to a different object.**

### 2.3.3. Understanding Compound Type Declaractions

```cpp
int i = 1024, *p = &i, &r = i;
```

> Tip
>
> There is no single right way to define pointers or references. The important thing is to choose a style and use it consistently.

## 2.4. `const` Qualifier

Define a variable whose value cannot be changed.

## 2.4.1. References to const

A reference to `const` cannot be used to change the object to which the reference is bound.

> Terminology: `const` Reference is a Reference to `const`
>
> There are no `const` references. A reference is not an object, so we cannot make a reference itself `const`. in some sense all references are `const`.

```cpp
double dval = 3.14;
const int &ri = dval;


// Transform
const int temp = dval; // create a temporay const int from the double
const int &ri = temp; // bind ri to that temporary
```

### 2.4.2. Pointers and `const`

A **pointer to const** may not be used to change the object to which the pointer points.

We may store the address of a `const` object only in a pointer to `const`.

```cpp
const double pi = 3.14;
double *ptr = &pi; // error;
const double *cptr = &pi; // ok
*cptr = 42; // error: cannot assign to *cptr
```

### 2.4.3. Top-Level `const`

**top-level const** indicate that the pointer itself is a `const`.

**low-level const** indicate a pointer can point to a `const` object.

```cpp
int i = 0;
int *const p1 = &i; // we can't change the value of p1; const is top-level
const int ci = 42;
const int *p2 = &ci; // we can change p2; const is low-level
const int *const p3 = p2; // right-most const is top-level, left-most is not
const int &r = ci; // const in reference types is always low-level
```

### 2.4.4. `constexpr` and Constant Expressions

A **constant expression** is an expression whose value cannot change and that can be evaluated at compile time.

## 2.5. Dealing with Types

### 2.5.2. The `auto` Type Specifier

`auto`: let the compiler figure out the type for use

```cpp
// the type of item is deduced from the type of the result of adding val1 and val2
auto item = val1 + val2; // item initialized to the result of val1 + v2
```

### 2.5.3. The `decltype` Type Specifier

returns the type of its operand.

```cpp
decltype(f()) sum = x;
```

the compiler does not call f, but it uses the type that such a call would return as the type for sum.

```cpp
const int ci = 0, &cj = ci;
decltype(cj) x = 0; // x has type const int
decltype(cj) y = x; // y has type const int& and is bound to x
decltype(cj) z; // error: z is a reference and must be initialized
```

#### `decltype` and References

```cpp
// decltype of an expression can be a reference type
int i = 42, *p = &i, &r = i;
decltype(r+0) b; // ok: additional yields an int; b is an (unintialized) int
decltype(*p) c; // error: c is int& and must be initialized

// decltype of a parenthesized variable is always a reference
decltype((i)) d; // error: d is int& and must be initizlied
decltype(i) e; // ok: e is an (unintialized) int
```

> **Warning**
>
> `decltype`''((variable)) (not, double, parentheses) is always a reference type, but `decltype`(variable) is a reference type only if variable is a reference.
