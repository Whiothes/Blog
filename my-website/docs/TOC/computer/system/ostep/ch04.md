## 4.1 The Abstraction: The Process

**abstraction**: a running program.

special registers:

- **program counter (PC)/instruction pointer (IP)**: tells us which instruction of the program will execute next;
- **stack pointer(SP)**: associated **frame pointer** are used to manage the stack for function parameters, local variables, and return address.

## 4.2 Process API

- **Create**: An operating system must include some method to create new processes.
- **Destroy**: destroy a process
- **Wait**: wait a process to stop running
- **Miscellaneous Control**: other than killing or waiting for a process, a process can be suspended or resume it
- **Status**: get status information about a process

## 4.4 Process States

- **Running**: a process is on a processro
- **Ready**: a process is ready to run but for some reason the OS has chosen not to run it as a given moment
- **Blocked**: a process has performed some kind of operation that makes it not ready to run until some other event take place. (e.g., keybord input)

## 4.5 Data Structures

```c
// the registers xv6 will save and restore
// to stop and subsequently restart a process
struct context {
    int eip;
    int esp;
    int ebx;
    int ecx;
    int edx;
    int esi;
    int edi;
    int ebp;
};


// the different states a process can be in
enum proc_state { UNUSED, EMBRYO, SLEEPING, RUNNABLE, RUNNING, ZOMBIE };

// the information xv6 tracks about each process
// including its register context and state
struct proc {
    char * mem;                                  // Start of process memory
    uint sz;                                     // Size of process memory
    char * kstack;                               // Bottom of kernel stack for this process
    enum proc_state state;                       // Process state
    int pid;                                     // Process ID
    struct proc * parent;                        // Parent process
    void * chan;                                 // If !zero, sleeping on chan
    int killed;                                  // If !zero, has been killed
    struct file * ofile[NOFILE];                 // Open files
    struct inode * cwd;                          // Current directory
    struct context context;                      // Switch here to run process
    struct trapframe * tf;                       // Trap frame for the
};
```

## 4.6 Summary

- **process** is the major OS abstraction of a running program.
- **process API**: creation, destruction, and so on.
- **process states**: running, ready to run, and blocked.
- **process list** contains information about all processes in the system. Each entry called **process control block (PCB)**.
