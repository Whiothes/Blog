# Chapter 6. The Memory Hierarchy #

## 6.1 Storage Technologies ##

### 6.1.1 Random Access Memory ###

#### Static RAM ####

**SRAM**  stores each bit in a _bistable_ memory cell. Each cell is implemented with a **six-transistor** circuit.

#### Dynamic RAM ####

**DRAM** stores each bit as charge on a capacitor.

A DRAM memory cell is very sensitive to any disturbance. When the capacitor voltage is disturbed, it will never recover.

#### Conventional DRAMs ####

#### Memory Modules ####


#### Nonvolatile Memory ####

DRAMs and SRAMs are _volatile_ in the sense they lose their information if the supply voltage is turned off.
_Nonvolatile Memories_ retain their information even when they are powed off. which refered to **ROMs** (read-only memories, for historical reasons), some types of ROMs can be written as well as read.

_programmable ROM (PROM)_ can be programmed exactly once.

_erasable programming ROM_ (EPROM) has a transparent quartz window that permits light to reach the storage cells. cleared to zeros by ultraviolet light through the window

_electrically EPROM (EEPROM)_ is akin to an EPROM without physically programming device required.

_Flash memory_, based on EEPROMs. _solid state disk (SSD)_


Programs stored in ROM devices are often referred to as _firmware_ .

Complicated devices such as graphics cards and disk drive controllers also rely on firmware to translate I/O (input/output) requests from the CPU.

#### Accessing Main Memory ####

A _read transaction_ transfers data from the main memory to the CPU. A _write transaction_ transfers data from the CPU to the main memory.


The main components are the CPU chip, a chipset we will call an _I/O bridge_ (which includes the memory controller), and the DRAM memory modules that make up main memory.


CPU performs a load operation:
```asm
movq A, %rax
```

CPU performs a store operation:
```asm
movq %rax, A
```

### 6.1.2 Disk Storage ###

- _Seek time_. To read the contents of some target sector, the arm first positions the head over the track that contains the target sector.

- _Rotational latency_. Once the head is in position over the track, the drive waits for the first bit of the target sector to pass under the head.

$$
\begin{align}
&T_{\text{max rotation}} = \frac{1}{\text{RPM}} \times \frac{60 \; \text{secs}}{1 \; \text{min}} \\
&T_{\text{avg rotation }} = \frac{1}{2} \times T_{\text{max rotation}}
\end{align}
$$


- _Transfer time_. When the first bit of the target sector is under the head, the drive can begin to read or write the contents of the sector.

$$
T_{\text{avg transfer}} = \frac{1}{\text{RPM}} \times \frac{1}{\text{average number of sectors/track}} \times \frac{60 \; \text{secs}}{1 \; \text{min}}
$$

#### Disk Operation ####

##### Practice Problem 6.3 #####

Estimate the average time (in ms) to access a sector on the following disk

| Parameter                       | Value     |
|---------------------------------|-----------|
| Rotational rate                 | 15000 RPM |
| $T_\text{avg seek}$             | 8 ms      |
| Average number of sectors/track | 500       |

- Solution:
$$
\begin{aligned}
T_\text{access} &= T_\text{avg seek} + T_\text{avg rotation} + T_\text{avg transfer} \\
                &= 8 + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{60}{15000} \times 1000 \text{ms} /\sec + \frac{60}{15000} \times \frac{1}{500} \times 1000 \text{ms} / \sec \\
                &= 8 + 2 + 0.008 \\
                &= 10.008 \; \text{ms}
\end{aligned}
$$

## 6.3 The Memory Hierarchy ##

_Figure 6.21 The memory hierarchy_
</div>

### Cache Hits ###

the data object cached at level _k_

### Cache Misses ###

the data object is not cached at level _k_

### Kinds of Cache Misses ###

- _compulsory misses_
- _cold misses_: are important because they are often transient events that might not occur in steady state, after the cache has been warmed up by repeated memory


### Cache Management ###
the essence of the memory hierarchy is that the storage device at each level is a cache for the next lower level. At each level, some form of logic must _manage_ the cache.

## 6.4 Cache Memories ##

### 6.4.1 Generic Cache Memory Organization ###

### 6.4.2 Direct-Mapped Caches ###

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}>

![](ch06/fig6.27.svg)

Figure 6.27 **Direct-Mapped cache** (E_ = 1). There is exactly one line per set_
</div>

The process taht a cache goes through of determining whether a request is a hit or a miss and then extracting the requested word consist of three steps:
1. set selection
2. line matching
3. word extraction

#### Set Selection in Direct-Mapped Caches ####

#### Line Matching in Direct-Mapped Caches ####

![](ch06/fig6.29.svg)

Figure 6.29 **Line matching and word selection in a direct-mapped cache.** Within the cache block, $w0$ denotes the low-order byte of the word $w$, $w_1$ the next byte, and so on.
</div>

#### Word Selection in Direct-Mapped Caches ####

the block offset bits provide the offset of the first byte in the desired word.

#### Line Replacement on Missess in Direct-Mapped Caches ####

if the cache misses, then it needs to retrive the requested block from the next level in the memory hierarchy and sotre the new block in one of the cache lines of the set indicated by the set index bits.

#### Putting It Together: A Direct-Mapped Cache in Action ####

- The concatenation of the tag and index bits uniquely identifies each block in memory.
- Since there are eight memory blcoks but only four cache sets, multiple blocks map to the sam cache set (i.e., they have the sam set index).
- Blocks that map to the same cache set are uniquely identified by the tag.

| Set | Valid | Tag | block[0] | block[1] |
|-----|-------|-----|----------|----------|
| 0   | 0     |     |          |          |
| 1   |       |     |          |          |

#### Conflict Misses in Direct-Mapped Caches ####


* Why index with the middle bits?

**pay attention on the colour of block and bolded numebr**, with the middle-order bit indexing, the cache can hold an enter $C$-size chunk of the array
