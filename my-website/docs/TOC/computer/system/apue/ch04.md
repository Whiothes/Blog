# Chapter 4. Fiiles and Directories #

## 4.14 File Systems ##

The i-nodes are fixed-length entries that contain most of the information about a file.

Note points:
- Two directory entries point to the same entry. Every i-node has a _link count_ that contains the number of directory entries that point to it. Only when the link count goes to __0__ can the file be deleted
- The other type of link is called a _symbolic link_. the actual contents of the file--the data blocks--store the name of the file that the symbolic link points to.
- The i-node contains all the information about the file.

## 4.17 Symbolic Links ##

- Hard links normally require that the link and the file reside in the same file system
- Only the superuser can create a hardlink to a directory (when supported by the underlying file system)
