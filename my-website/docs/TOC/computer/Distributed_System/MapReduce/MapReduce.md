# MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters

## Abstract

a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets.

- *map* function processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, 

- *reduce* function merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key.
