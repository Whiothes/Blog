# 4. MASTER OPERATION

## 4.1 Namespace Management and Locking

GFS logically represents its namespace as a lookup table mapping full pathnames to metadata.

Each master operation acquires a set of locks before it runs.

multiple file creations can be executed concurrently in the same director: each acquires **a read lock on the directory name** and **a write lock on the file name**.

## 4.2 Replica Placement

The chunk replica placement policy serves two purposes: maximize data reliability and availability, and maximize network bandwidth utilization.

## 4.3 Creation, Re-replication, Rebalancing

master considers:

1. place new replicas on chunkservers with below-average disk space utilization.
2. limit the number of "recent" creations on each chunkserver.
3. spread replicas of a chunk across racks.

## 4.4 Garbage Collection

GFS dose not immediately reclaim the available physical storage after a file is deleted

### 4.4.1 Mechanism

the file is deleted is just renamed to a hidden name that includes the deletion timestamp. The master removes any such hidden files existed for specified times during the master's regular scan of the file system.

## 4.5 Stale Replica Detection

the master maintains a *chunk version number* to distinguish between up-to-date and stale replicas.

The master removes stale replicas in its regular garbage collection.
