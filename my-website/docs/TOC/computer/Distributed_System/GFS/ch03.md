1. The client ask for server holds the current lease for the chunk and the locations of the other replicas.
1. The master replies with the identity of the primary and the locations of the other replicas.

1. The primary forwards the write request to all secondary replicas.
1. The secondaries all reply to the primary indicating that they have completed the operation.
1. The primary replies to the client.

## 3.3 Atomic Record Appends

GFS appends it to the file at least once atomically (i.e., as one continuous sequence of bytes) at an offset of GFS's choosing and returns that offset to the client.

## 3.4 Snapshot

The snapshot operation makes a copy of a file or a directory tree almost instantaneously, while minimizing any interruptions of ongoing mutations.
