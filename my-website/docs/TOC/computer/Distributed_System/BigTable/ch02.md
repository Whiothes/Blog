## Rows

The rows keys in a table are arbitary strings (currently up to 64KB in size). Every read or write of data under a single row key is **atomic**.

Bigtable maintains data in lexicographic order by row key.

## Column Families

Column keys are grouped into sets called *calumn families*, which form the basic nit of access control.

A column key is named using the following syntax: *family:qualifiers*. Column family names must be printable, but qualifiers may be arbitrary strings.

## Timestamps

Each cell in a Bigtab le can contain multiple versions of the same data;  indexed by timestamp, 64-bit integers.
