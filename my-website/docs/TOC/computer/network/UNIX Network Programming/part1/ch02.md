# 2 The Transport Layer: TCP, UDP, and SCTP

## 2.6 TCP Connection Establishment and Termination

### TCP Options

- MSS option. _maximum segment size_ of data that it is willing to accept in each TCP segment on this connection.
- Window Scale option. 65535 (16 bits in the TCP header), `SO_RCVBUF` to acquire larger window
- Timestamp option. to prevent possible data corruption by old, delayed, or duplicated segments.
