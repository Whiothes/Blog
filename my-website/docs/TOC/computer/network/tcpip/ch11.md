# Chapter 11. Name Resolution and the Domain Name System (DNS) #

## 11.1 Introduction ##

DNS is a distributed client/server networked database that is used by TCP/IP applications
to map between host names and IP addresses (and vice versa), to provide electronic mail routing
information, service naming, and other capabilities.

## 11.2 The DNS Name Space ##

The set of all names used with DNS constitutes the DNS _name space_.

## 11.3 Name Servers and Zones ##

The unit of administrative delegation, in the language of DNS servers, is called a zone

## 11.4 Caching ##

Most name servers (except some of the root and TLD servers) also cache zone information they learn, up to a time limit called the _time to live_ (TTL).

They use this cached information to answer queries.
